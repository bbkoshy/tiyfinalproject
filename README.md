**Elevator Pitch: **

UX jobs are a part of a new wave of digital positions dedicated to, amongst other things, improving the response websites get and ensuring users have the best experience online.

One of the reasons I decided to become a UX designer is so that i could help make the world wide web a  more inclusive place for people of all race, religion, gender, and sexuality. I can’t pretend to know much, but here’s what I do know: People are so different. I truly believe that everyone is a special snowflake. But, it has been proven that groups of people can fit into certain patterns. I’m not talking about stereotypes, I’m talking about web use, preferences in user design and overall user experience. Sets of people have different priorities when it comes to navigating a specific type of website. 

**Who, What, When Where, and Why**:

Of course, the variables from here  only continue to expand exponentially when you factor in what kind of website they are using and the end goal of the user. For the purposes of this study, I want to dig a little deeper on the topic of gender preferences. This idea came about as a result of working on a group project in class. While I’ve always been taken with gender studies, it was most recently that I noticed a stark difference in how the girls and guys of my class design and the factors they keep in mind when they are designing. Note: there are two guys and two girls including myself. We were completely divided in our priorities when it came to redesigning craigslist. It had a lot to do with the way we view and interact with the real world in regards to gender. Now, I’m not so naive as to think that this is a black and white issue. I think it varies from site to site. 

The site that I am interested in redesigning is Reddit. Reddit’s mission statement is this: Reddit bridges communities and individuals with ideas, the latest digital trends, and breaking news (...okay, and maybe cats). Our mission is to help people discover places where they can be their true selves, and empower our community to flourish.

Reddit appeals to both men and women and they dub themselves “the front page of the internet”. 

**Pages to be Redesigned: **

_The Homepage_ - 3 versions : female, and male and a combination of both. 

_New on Reddit _- 2 versions: female, and male. 

_Additional libraries:_

[**Flickerplate**](https://github.com/chrishumboldt/Rocket-Flicker) is a responsive, touch-enabled and lightweight plugin that allows you to ‘flick’ through content.

[**Simple jQuery Slider**](http://simpleslider.bitlabs.nl/)
